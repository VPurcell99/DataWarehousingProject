Team 5 - HW5
Team5: Vince Purcell, Brandon Mondile

As a note,
Team 4's sales data did not track cases bought so their data will be off. If Team 4 provides 
corrected data then we can rerun the jupyter nb to generate new tables with correct data

Wanted to mention that in case discrepancies were found
